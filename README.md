Lloyd’s Algorithm:
Intuition:
Lloyd’s algorithm is closely related to the k-means clustering algorithm.
It aims to find centroids (mean points) for a given set of data points while minimizing the variance within each cluster.
The algorithm repeatedly computes the centroid of each set in the partition and then re-partitions the input based on which centroid is closest.
In this context, the mean operation is an integral over a region of space, and the nearest centroid operation results in Voronoi diagrams.
Objective:

Given a dataset with N data points and a desired number of clusters K, the goal is to find K centroids such that the sum of squared distances (variance) from each data point to its nearest centroid is minimized.
The optimization objective can be expressed as:J=i=1∑N​jmin​∥xi​−μj​∥2
where:

(x_i) represents the (i)-th data point.
(\mu_j) denotes the centroid of the (j)-th cluster.





Algorithm Steps:

Initialize K centroids (e.g., randomly or using a heuristic).
Repeat until convergence:

Compute the Voronoi diagram of the K sites.
Integrate each cell of the Voronoi diagram and compute the centroid.
Move each site to the centroid of its Voronoi cell.





Choosing the Number of Clusters (K):

The “elbow method” can help determine an appropriate value for K:

Compute the cost function for different values of K.
Plot the cost function against K.
Look for the “elbow point” where the cost starts decreasing at a slower rate.


Other methods include silhouette score, Davies–Bouldin index, and cross-validation.



Applications:

Lloyd’s algorithm can be used to construct close approximations to centroidal Voronoi tessellations of the input.
Applications include:

Quantization
Dithering
Stippling
Smoothing of triangle meshes in finite element methods.





Approximation:

Due to the complexity of Voronoi diagram construction, approximations are often used.
A common simplification involves discretizing space (e.g., using a fine pixel grid) and approximating centroids based on pixel labels.



!Lloyd’s Algorithm Iterations
Example of Lloyd’s algorithm iterations. The Voronoi diagram of the current site positions (red) at each iteration is shown. The gray circles denote the centroids of the Voronoi cells.
In summary, Lloyd’s algorithm is a powerful technique for clustering and partitioning data, and it has applications beyond just clustering.
